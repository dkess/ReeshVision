# ReeshVision
This Python script uses a laptop webcam to allow the operator to send signals to the robot's cRIO, even during autonomous mode. These signals are in the form of two sliders, controlled by hand motions.

## Configuration
An example configuration file is provided. To use it, rename it to `config`.

## Robot code example
Coming soon!

## Requirements
See [Team 254's CheesyVision page](https://github.com/Team254/CheesyVision) for information about requirements. This script requires Python 2.7, Numpy, and OpenCV 2.
